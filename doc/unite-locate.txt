CUSTOMIZING					*unite-locate-customizing*

g:unite_locate_command			*g:unite_locate_command*
	Specifies an alternative command to lookup files. If you don't give
	this value and you have locate command and you are not on Linux, it's
	same to have given 'locate -l {count} {query}' as this value. In the
	same condition but on Linux, it's 'locate -l {count} -e {query}'. On
	Windows it'll be 'es -i -r -n {count} {query}'. {count} means the
	number of items to fetch at one time, and {query} is the user input.
	On Mac it can be mdfind instead of locate, depending on the system.

	locate: for UNIX. mlocate.
	mdfind: ???
	es: for Windows. voidtools's everything.
