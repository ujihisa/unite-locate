CUSTOMIZING					*unite-locate-customizing*

g:unite_locate_command			*g:unite_locate_command*
	Specifies an alternative command to lookup files. If you don't give
	this value and you have locate command and you are not on Linux, it's
	same to have given 'locate -l %d %s' as this value. In the same
	condition but on Linux, it's 'locate -l %d -e %s'. On Windows it'll be
	'es -i -r -n %d %s'. %d means the number of items to fetch at one
	time, and %s is the user input.
